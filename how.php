<h1>How Offices were Assigned</h1>

<p>Dr. Smith will make a priority list of all GTAs based on prelims passed and any other criteria he decides is important.  I'm told ties will be broken by random.</p>

<p>Once the deadline has passed, the program will automatically go through this list in order and assign the most preferred office that is still available to each GTA. In the unlikely event that all ten offices are filled, then that GTA will be skipped and given a random assignment.</p>

<p>If you have a <em>confirmed</em> officemate (both of you have the other listed), then the first one of the pair in the priority list determines the priority of the pair, and the pair will be simultaneously assigned an office. <strike>For this reason 2- or 4-person offices may be reserved for GTAs who have requested officemates.</strike></p>

<p>Unconfirmed officemates are ignored, so make sure your roommate lists you as well!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A note from Dr. Smith on the sorting:</p>

<p><blockquote>
The number of prelims passed was the main factor used for prioritization together with a weighted randomization.  The weighing had something to do with progress towards the plan of study and included such factors as entry date and other publically available information. You can tell them that I personally created the ordered list and passed it on to you.  I made sure that, with the exception of number of prelims passed, that the list has such a high degree of randomness that it does not indicate a ranking of the students by any confidential measure (such
as GPA).
